# QuoteVault

"QuoteVault" is a modern Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) application designed to deliver daily inspiration right to your fingertips. Built with 100% Compose UI, it targets Android, iOS, and Desktop platforms, providing a consistent and delightful user experience across all devices.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multiplatform Support:** Seamlessly runs on Android, iOS, and Desktop.

* **Daily Quotes:** Fetches inspiring quotes from a public API.

* **Clean UI:** Beautiful and intuitive user interface built entirely with Compose Multiplatform.

* **Shimmer Effect:** Provides a smooth loading experience with shimmer animations.

* **Theming:** Dynamic and consistent theming across platforms using MaterialKolor.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project adheres to a **Clean Architecture** approach, leveraging the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern and a dedicated **Repository Pattern** to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

* **Model:** Represents the data and business logic.

* **View:** The Compose UI, responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions.

* **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge between the View and the Model, exposing data streams and handling UI-related logic.

* **Repository:** Abstracts the data sources (e.g., network API, local database), providing a clean API for the ViewModels to retrieve and store data without knowing the underlying implementation details.
